        <h3>I need assistance but I don’t know where to start, what do I do?</h3>
        <p>If you have a service request or you require assistance that is associated with something you actively use at RMIT then submit a ticket through our <a href="#">service requests</a>. If you are having an issue or cannot find help elsewhere then submit an issue ticket through our <a href="#">issue report</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I have a service based issue but I’m not sure what category it belongs in, what do I do?</h3>
        <p>That’s ok. If you cannot find a suitable category for your query then please submit it through our general enquiry form <a href="#">here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I forgot my password and need to change it, where can I change my password?</h3>
        <p>You can manage your passwords <a href="#">here</a>. If you have any issues resetting your password or require further assistance you can lodge an <a href="#">issue ticket</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do I need to change my password every <i>x</i> number of days?</h3>
        <p>We aren’t quite sure. This is some weird security restriction we imposed. It doesn’t really hurt though. When you change your password often it keeps both you and any potential wrongdoers on their feet!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I received an email that says they’re from RMIT and asks for my password, what should I do?</h3>
        <p>RMIT will never ask for your password through email (at least we shouldn’t, who knows).  Do not open this message or any attachments, or is it too late? Please report this as an issue via this portal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>Why do I get asked to send feedback so regularly?</h3>
        <p>Feedback helps RMIT immensely. This allows RMIT to iterate based off of the information you have provided us. Without this information we would not be able to improve our services.</p>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <h3>I am receiving pop up errors when trying to open files, what should I do?</h3>
